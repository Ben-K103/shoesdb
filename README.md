# Blueprint
Welcome to my Github! This is a project about web scrapping shoes data with Selenium (Python) from Marathon and Catalog HK, and store the data into a PostgreSQL database. This is the interim project from the Junior Data Engineerer Program (CLAP@JC X Generation). Continuously updating and improving!
